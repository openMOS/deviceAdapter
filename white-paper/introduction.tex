\section{Introduction}

The \gls{openMOS} project targets the modern production systems that are currently transforming from mass production towards mass customization demanding agile solutions to support a running system during its build, ramp-up, production, reconfiguration phases.

The vision of the \gls{openMOS} is targeted at maximizing the economic sustainability of production systems by following three main innovation strands: (1) enabling ‘Plug-and-Produce’ capabilities for automation equipment, robots and machines, (2) aiding horizontal and vertical communication between all hardware and software entities, and (3) creating a manufacturing operating system that is easily extendable and adaptable towards the introduction of new products, work orders and equipment modules, which envisages easy deployment, optimization and changeover management strategies.
