\section{Benefits}
\gls{AML} enables a seamless integration of the \gls{openMOS} technology with existing engineering tools and provides a decoupled device description with a clear set of rules for hierarchical aggregation reflecting the system hardware architecture.

\gls{openMOS} \gls{DA} allows an integration of various devices with different technology stacks into the \gls{openMOS} system, enriching the devices with automatic discovery functionality and enabling skill triggering mechanism.

In the \gls{openMOS} project there is a clear distinction between production optimization and time-critical production execution.
\gls{MSB} guarantees that production is executed continuously even if the cloud is not operating.

the \gls{openMOS} agent cloud and \gls{HMI} provide system optimization recommendations both for cycle time and energy consumption and ramp-up decision support. 
It allows to contextually store all data related to the product, process and system that is then used for the system overall performance optimization.

A clear benefit of the \gls{openMOS} technology is its modularity: it is not needed to deploy every module of the whole software stack developed, one can pick only the functionality that is needed for a particular system.
This increases an industrial adoption of the project results as it is not required to the full stack, just choosing the demanded features.
